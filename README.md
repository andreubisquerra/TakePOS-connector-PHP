# TakePOS Connector

The TakePOS connector allows print to receipt printers and use scales and other hardware from TakePOS. TakePOS can be installed locally or in the cloud. The connector must be on the local computer.

It uses the mike42 library to generate the files to be printed and our small Java components to communicate with the printers and use other hardware. Installation is very simple, no database required.

TakePOS is included in Dolibarr and can be downloaded from [oficial website](http://takepos.com)
